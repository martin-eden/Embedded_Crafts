# My creations for embedded projects

(2016 .. )

Look into specific directories, some (will) have their own ReadMe's.

Firmware for physical projects is in "Ships". More generic code in "Parts".

Projects are frozen in their time. Code is mostly for reading.

For some of them I'm still proud, most are curious, some are just personal
memories.

I would design most of them quite differently today. (I hope I can
say the same about my recent projects couple of years later.)

Still, code should be compilable when you collect all required libraries.
If not, open issue.

License is GPLv3 if I forgot to place it.
