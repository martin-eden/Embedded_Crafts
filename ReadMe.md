## What

 (since 2016)

 My creations for embedded projects

* Infrastructure

  [ino][ino] - one-line command to compile, upload and open serial monitor.
    (Plus more granular but short commands.)
  [GetLibs][GetLibs] - shell script to deploy/remove *all* my active libraries.

* [Libraries](Parts)

  Libraries, over two dozen of them!

* [Projects](Ships)

  Projects are frozen in their time. Code is mostly for reading.

  Still, code should be compilable when you collect all required libraries.
  If not, open issue.

* Graveyard

  * [Early projects/libraries][Scrapyard]
