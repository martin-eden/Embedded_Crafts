# My creations for embedded projects

(2016 .. )

* [Infrastructure][acli]

  Shell scripts for automation over `arduino-cli`

* [Libraries](Parts)
* [Projects](Ships)

Projects are frozen in their time. Code is mostly for reading.

Still, code should be compilable when you collect all required libraries.
If not, open issue.

License is GPLv3 if I forgot to place it.
