## What

 (since 2016)

 My creations for embedded projects

* Infrastructure

  [ino][ino] - one-line command to compile, upload and open serial monitor.
    (Plus more granular but short commands.)
  [GetLibs][GetLibs] - shell script to deploy/remove *all* my active libraries.

* [Libraries](Parts)

  Libraries, over two dozen of them!

* [Projects](Ships)

  Some projects are frozen in their time. Code is mostly for reading.
  And for proof of feat.

  Code for others depends on current framework. It should be compilable.

* Graveyard

  * [Early projects/libraries][Scrapyard]
