## What

 (2016 .. )

 My creations for embedded projects

* [Infrastructure][acli]

  Shell scripts for automation over `arduino-cli`

* [Libraries](Parts)

  Libraries, over dozen of them!

* [Projects](Ships)

  Projects are frozen in their time. Code is mostly for reading.

  Still, code should be compilable when you collect all required libraries.
  If not, open issue.

License is GPLv3 if I forgot to place it.
